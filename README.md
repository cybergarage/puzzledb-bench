[PuzzleDB](https://github.com/cybergarage/puzzledb-go) is a high-performance and lightweight embedded database program written in Go. It provides a fast and reliable solution for storing and accessing large amounts of data in a variety of applications. 

In order to showcase its speed and efficiency, we have developed a benchmark program that measures the performance of PuzzleDB-Go against other popular database programs. 

This benchmark program is open-source and available for download on our GitHub page. We invite developers and enthusiasts to use this program to evaluate PuzzleDB-Go and compare its performance to other database programs.

# Benchmark Utilities

This repository provides benchmark utilities to compare the performance of the official Docker image with PuzzleDB.

- [redis-bench](redis-bench)
- [mongo-bench](mongo-bench)
- [mysql-bench](mysql-bench)
- [pg-bench](pg-bench)

The performance results of these benchmark commands are outputted to the `log` directory.
